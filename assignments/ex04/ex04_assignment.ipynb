Another challenge is interpretation and world knowledge; since everyone has different knowledge and experiences, the same sentence can be interpreted differently by different people. A third challenge is anaphora and coreference resolution. To understand what a pronoun or reference word refers to, a system must often rely on context and sometimes even real-world knowledge."

Depending on the value of n, the model can be a unigram(each word is tagged independently), bigram(the tag of the current word depends only on the tag of the previous word), trigram(depends on the two preceding tags.), and so on. It involves calculating probabilities based on a tagged training corpus and selecting the most likely sequence of tags for a given sentence. One major limitatiion is that it struggles with long-distance dependencies between words, as it only considers a limited context window. Additionally, because it relies on previously seen data, it may fail to accurately tag unknown words that do not appear in the training set."
